## 3D printable drone frame, SMT32-based flight controller and flight controller code

Hobby project, a homemade drone with custom flight controller and frame.
Do not use this for anything serious, it's just a hobby project.

Folder contents (see readmes for more details):
- `3dp` - Freecad projects with 3D printable drone parts
- `code` - code for the flight controller
- `customboard` - KiCad project for flight controller PCB

I couldn't be bothered to do in-detail docs, feel free to email me at (reverse the string to get my email) `moc.liamg@528alokin`
